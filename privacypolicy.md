Benjamin Peter Kern built the Solar Quiz app as an open source app. This SERVICE is provided by Benjamin Peter Kern at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

**Information Collection and Use**

No data is being collected. The only data that is stored on your device is the data describing the solar bodies, which is obtained through the solar system api. The purpose of storing this data is to allow Solar Quiz to be played offline.
You can find more information on that under the point "service providers".

**Log Data**

No logging data is being collected.

**Cookies**

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
The app does not use any cookies.

**Service Providers**

Solar Quiz uses the open data solar system api to create its questions. You can find more information about it here: https://api.le-systeme-solaire.net
